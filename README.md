# How To Report a Security Vunerability 

If you find a security vunerability at all or have any slight doubt, contact me right away in the issues tab.
If I do not answer before 48 hours, email me at tekmunity@gmail.com and I'll be sure to get back to your as soon
as possible.




# Found an error in our code?

If you find an error in our code, I will offer you ownership of the code and completly delete it from the location.
All you have to do is message me in the issues tab and specify the error. I will then run a deep analysis through the whole code
and I will review it even after. If the error you stated is true. You will gain the ownership.



# Helping people stay secure

We just hate it when hackers are trying to steal info.
I've experienced lots of malware attacks when I tested some dangerous sites.
Some went as far as corrupting the whole OS and some did as little as changing a few shortcuts to a malicious sites shortcut in disguise.
Malware has even caused buisnesses to close down.
Some people just won't understand how dangerous malware can be.
Not only that, but now, McAfee is even reporting that 100,000 new malware programs are created on a daily basis.
That's insane! So are we going to stand there or do something about it?
We are going to try our best to help people stay more secure and research deeply for security vunerabilities.
We want to help people even if it involves some of the biggest risks and we won't give up. Right now we only
have a group of three to help, but if you want to join, we would be more than glad to have you.
Let us make a change by developing powerful security applications and stopping as many scams and malware attacks as possible.
We believe in you and we hope you believe in us.
