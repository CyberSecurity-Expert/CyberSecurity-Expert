# Welcome

Welcome to my profile. My name is Adam Abdallah and it is a pleasure to have your visit here. I like to call myself "Some Random Developer" on GitHub.
We accept all ideas and commits in order to help. I also spend some of my time commiting to repositories on GitHub and helping others grow their account.

# How To Report a Security Vunerability 

If you find a security vunerability at all or have any slight doubt, contact me right away in the issues tab.
If I do not answer before 48 hours, email me at tekmunity@gmail.com and I'll be sure to get back to your as soon
as possible. Lastly, if I do not get back with your very soon, you can annoy me. I guess. Or just leave me be.




# Found an error in our code?

If you find an error in our code, I will offer you ownership of the code and completly delete it from the location.
All you have to do is message me in the issues tab and specify the error. I will then run a deep analysis through the whole code
and I will review it even after. If the error you stated is true. You will gain the ownership.
